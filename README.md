# datasets-exploration
Collection of my explorations of datasets, which includes:
- datasets preparation
- datasets cleaning
- datasets analysis
- applying machine learning algorithms etc.

## Important
Datasets are stored by using "Git Large File Storage".
In order to clone them with the repository, install and enable Git LFS.
See: https://git-lfs.github.com/

### Or alternatively you can download them from here:
My Yandex.Disk: https://yadi.sk/d/0l5sVJjV3RV3AK

Just replace "datasets" folder from cloned repository to downloaded folder from Yandex.Disk.
